          Profile is the Schema for the profiles API.
          A Profile defines a template configuration that can be applied to Kubernetes resources
          through ProfileBindings. Profiles are cluster-scoped resources that contain reusable
          configuration templates.

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.

                  conditions represent the current state of the Profile resource.
                  Each condition has a unique type and reflects the status of a specific aspect of the resource.

                  Standard condition types include:
                  - "Available": the resource is fully functional
                  - "Progressing": the resource is being created or updated
                  - "Degraded": the resource failed to reach or maintain its desired state

                  The status of each condition is one of True, False, or Unknown.
                items:

                        lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
                        This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.
